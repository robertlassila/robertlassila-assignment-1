            <h1>Functional Music to Improve</h1>
            <h1>Focus in 15 Minutes</h1>
            <p>Our science-first approach creates music that 
                sounds different-and affects 
                your brain differently-than any other music.</p>

                <h2>Patented Technology</h2>
                <p>Brain.fm holds patents on key processes for creating functional music,
                     including technology to elicit <strong>strong neural phase locking</strong>—allowing populations 
                     of neurons to engage in various kinds of coordinated activity—and technology to remove distraction in sound. <br/><br/>
                    This makes our music unique, purpose-built to steer you into a desired mental state. 
                    In other words, we’ve found new ways to create music that helps you do what you need to do.<br/><br/>

                <h2>Tested on Brain and Behavior</h2>
                <p>Scientists at Brain.fm work with collaborators at academic institutions to run experiments. <br/><br/>
                    We look at the effects of our technology on the brain, 
                    using fMRI and EEG, and also run large-scale behavioral tests, 
                    measuring performance on simple games. <br/><br/>
                    <strong>Our experiments always include a control condition (‘placebo’)</strong>
                    of the same underlying music without Brain.fm technology applied, 
                    so we can be sure our tech is what makes the difference. <br/><br/>
